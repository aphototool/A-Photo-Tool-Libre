### How to Install

A Photo Tool (Libre) supports **Debian** based systems (Debian, Ubuntu etc.) and **Arch Linux** based systems.

Follow correct instructions below (.deb file for Debian and Arch AUR for Arch Linux). 

### How to Install (.deb for 64 bit Intel / AMD)

1. Download aphototoollibre_1.0.1-2_amd64.deb (see [Releases](../../releases))

2. You may check the file integrity (*this step is not required but is good for your safety*). 
- Enter command
```
sha256sum aphototoollibre_1.0.1-2_amd64.deb
```
- The result should be (*if not, do not install*)
```
3920116322319aa7671496446ff35eb6e81d4489fa6e53d19900a787fc8a1c19  aphototoollibre_1.0.1-2_amd64.deb
```
- You can compare the SHA256 message digest checksum at https://www.ahola.me/aphototoollibre.html to get additional confirmation.

3. Use your favorite graphical package manager to install. For command line use
```
sudo apt install ./aphototoollibre_1.0.1-2_amd64.deb
```
   - You may see error message at the end of otherwise successful installation about permission denied and performing as root. That is ok.
   - Package managers may show license as "proprietary". The license is actually GPLv3.

### How to Install (Arch User Repository (AUR) for 64 bit Intel / AMD)

A Photo Tool (Libre) is in the AUR repository https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aphototoollibre.

Instructions for AUR are here https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_and_upgrading_packages. 
You should be familiar with the instructions and security advice. AUR packages are not verified by Arch Linux.
Also see what is instructed in the **Prerequisites** to be ready for installing AUR packages if this is your first use of AUR.

Installation from AUR is multi step procedure but instructions below are easy to follow.
Arch Linux does not recommend use of helpper utilities that simplify installation 
as they usually skip manual verification of the application (like something that is done in step 3 below).

Steps to install A Photo Tool (Libre) from AUR.

1. Go to a folder where you process AUR installations. Make one if you don't have one ready.
2. Enter commands
```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/aphototoollibre.git
cd aphototoollibre
```

3. This step may be skipped but to always follow security guidelines inspect PKGBUILD file carefully. For example you may enter
```
less PKGBUILD
```

4. Build package
```
makepkg
```

- if build fails with **ERROR: One or more PGP signatures could not be verified!** then install public GPG signature for "aphototool". You can search for key with command `gpg --search-keys aphototool` but to install use
```
gpg --recv-keys A970F7E40CB64F0D5B9FC516AFE56C2DF614820C
```
- then enter `makepkg` again to rebuild.

5. Install build application. Use sudo as needed.
```
pacman -U aphototoollibre-1.0.1-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

#### Tested environment
- Arch Linux (KDE Plasma)

Absolutely **no** guarantee is given that this app will work on any tested or untested environment.
